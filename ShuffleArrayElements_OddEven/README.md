# Shuffle Array Elements Odd to Even

## Background

This is the coding problem that i got when applying for Junior Engineer at Shopee, Jakarta.

## Problems

Shuffle a string of numbers that separated with space (' '). The order is from odd to even and min to max. Input and output are a string that each number separated with space (' ").

Example: <br/>
Input = 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1<br/>
Output = 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0<br/><br/>

Input = 2 1 3 4 7 11 <br/>
Output = 1 3 7 11 2 4<br/>
